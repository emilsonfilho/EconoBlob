Naming Conventions
=================

This project follows a set of naming conventions to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase. Below is a detailed description of the conventions applied to various elements in the project:

Folder Names
------------

**UPPERCASE**

- All folder names are written in uppercase.
- This provides a clear distinction for directory names, especially useful for terminal navigation.

Variables
---------

**camelCase**

- Local variables use camelCase.
- This is a standard and widely adopted convention in JavaScript, enhancing readability.

Constants
---------

**UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES**

- Constants are written in uppercase with underscores separating words.
- This convention is reserved strictly for immutable values to avoid confusion with other elements.

Functions/Methods
-----------------

**camelCase**

- Functions and methods are named using camelCase.
- This aligns with the convention for variables, providing consistency across the codebase.

Classes
-------

**PascalCase**

- Class names follow PascalCase.
- This is consistent with object-oriented programming conventions and makes classes easy to identify.

Modules/Files
-------------

**kebab-case**

- File and module names are written in kebab-case.
- This is the standard naming convention for JavaScript files, particularly useful for imports.

Global Variables
----------------

**PascalCase**

- Global variables are named using PascalCase.
- This distinguishes them from constants while indicating their global scope.

Enums
-----

**PascalCase**

- Enum names use PascalCase.
- This convention is common in many programming languages and helps enums stand out without overloading camelCase.
